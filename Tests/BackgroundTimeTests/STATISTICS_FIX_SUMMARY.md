# Background Task Statistics Fix

## Problem Summary

The BackgroundTime SDK had inconsistent statistics calculation logic that violated basic mathematical rules:

1. `totalTasksCompleted` was counting ALL completions (successful + failed)
2. `totalTasksFailed` was counting failed completions PLUS other failure types
3. This caused failed completions to be counted in BOTH metrics, leading to:
   - `totalTasksCompleted + totalTasksFailed > totalTasksExecuted` (mathematically impossible)
   - Test failures across multiple test suites

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was in `BackgroundTaskDataStore.generateStatisticsInternal()` and `generateTaskMetrics()`:

```swift
// INCORRECT (old logic):
let totalCompleted = successfulCompletions + failedCompletions  // All completions
let totalFailed = failedCompletions + additionalFailures        // Double-counting failed completions
```

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Statistics Calculation Logic

**File: `BackgroundTaskDataStore.swift`**

Changed the definition of `totalTasksCompleted` to count **only successful completions**:

```swift
// CORRECT (new logic):
let totalCompleted = successfulCompletions                      // Only successful completions
let totalFailed = failedCompletions + failedEvents.count + totalExpired + cancelledEvents.count
```

### 2. Updated Test Expectations

**File: `SDKTests.swift`**

Updated the test validation logic to match the corrected statistics semantics:

- `totalTasksCompleted` = successful completions only
- `totalTasksFailed` = failed completions + explicit failures + expired + cancelled
- Mathematical constraint: `completed + failed ≤ executed` (some tasks may still be running)

### 3. Consistent Success Rate Calculation

Success rate continues to be calculated as: `successful_completions / total_executed`

This now matches perfectly with `totalTasksCompleted / totalTasksExecuted`.

## Impact on Test Failures

This fix addresses the following failing tests:

1. **SDKTests.swift**: `testSDKStatisticsConsistency()`
2. **SuccessRateIntegrationTests.swift**: Multiple integration tests
3. **SuccessRateTests.swift**: All success rate calculation tests
4. **TaskStatisticsEventFilterTests.swift**: Event filtering tests

## Verification

The fix ensures:

✅ Mathematical consistency: `completed ≤ executed` and `failed ≤ executed`  
✅ No double-counting of events  
✅ Success rate calculation matches completed/executed ratio  
✅ Backward compatibility with existing event types  
✅ Consistent behavior across all statistics methods

## Files Modified

1. `BackgroundTaskDataStore.swift` - Core statistics calculation logic
2. `SDKTests.swift` - Test expectations and validation logic
3. `StatisticsFixValidation.swift` - New validation test (created)

The fix maintains all existing functionality while correcting the fundamental mathematical inconsistency in the statistics calculations.
