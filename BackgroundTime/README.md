# BackgroundTime SDK

A comprehensive iOS SDK for monitoring and analyzing background task performance with thread-safe architecture and advanced analytics capabilities.

## üèóÔ∏è Core Architecture

### Thread-Safe Singleton Design
- **Singleton Pattern**: Thread-safe singleton implementation with proper initialization locks
- **Initialization Protection**: Uses `NSLock` to prevent race conditions during SDK initialization
- **Main Actor Isolation**: Strategic use of main actor isolation where appropriate

### Method Swizzling System
- **BGTaskScheduler Swizzling**: Automatic instrumentation of task scheduling, cancellation, and lifecycle
- **BGTask Lifecycle Tracking**: Monitors task execution, completion, and expiration events
- **Safe Swizzling**: Proper method exchange with error handling and logging
- **Enhanced Registration**: Provides `registerBackgroundTime` wrapper for seamless integration

### Memory-Efficient Storage
- **Circular Buffer**: Custom circular buffer implementation with configurable capacity
- **Thread-Safe Operations**: All buffer operations are protected with proper locking mechanisms
- **Memory Management**: Automatically drops oldest events when capacity is reached
- **Efficient Access Patterns**: Optimized for frequent reads and writes

### Reader-Writer Lock Implementation
- **Concurrent Access**: Uses `DispatchQueue` with concurrent reads and barrier writes
- **ThreadSafeDataStore**: Wrapper around circular buffer providing thread-safe operations
- **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in performance tracking for access patterns
- **Batch Operations**: Supports safe batch read/write operations

## üì¶ Package Manager Support

### Swift Package Manager
- **Package.swift**: Complete SPM configuration with platform support
- **Modular Structure**: Organized source files and resources
- **Test Targets**: Comprehensive test coverage including performance tests

### CocoaPods
- **Podspec**: Full CocoaPods specification with dependencies and configurations
- **Version Management**: Semantic versioning with proper deployment targets
- **Test Specifications**: Integrated test specs for quality assurance

### Manual Integration
- **Framework Structure**: Self-contained framework with all necessary components
- **Documentation**: Complete integration guide with examples
- **Compatibility**: Support for iOS 14+, macOS 11+, tvOS 14+, watchOS 7+, visionOS 1+

## üöÄ Key Features

### Automatic Instrumentation
```swift
// Automatically tracks all background task operations
BGTaskScheduler.shared.registerBackgroundTime(
    forTaskWithIdentifier: "com.app.refresh",
    using: nil
) { task in
    // Task lifecycle automatically monitored
    handleBackgroundTask(task)
}
```

### Thread-Safe Data Collection
```swift
// All operations are thread-safe
let stats = BackgroundTime.shared.getCurrentStats()
let events = BackgroundTime.shared.getAllEvents()

// Performance metrics available
let performance = BackgroundTime.shared.getDataStorePerformance()
let bufferStats = BackgroundTime.shared.getBufferStatistics()
```

### Real-Time Analytics
```swift
// Comprehensive dashboard data
let dashboardData = BackgroundTime.shared.exportDataForDashboard()

// Network sync capabilities
try await BackgroundTime.shared.syncWithDashboard()
```

## üîß Configuration Options

```swift
let config = BackgroundTimeConfiguration(
    maxStoredEvents: 5000,           // Circular buffer capacity
    apiEndpoint: URL(string: "..."), // Dashboard endpoint
    enableNetworkSync: true,         // Auto-sync with dashboard
    enableDetailedLogging: true      // Detailed operation logging
)

BackgroundTime.shared.initialize(configuration: config)
```

## üìä Performance Characteristics

### Memory Efficiency
- **Circular Buffer**: O(1) append operations with automatic memory management
- **Configurable Capacity**: Adjustable storage limits based on application needs
- **Minimal Overhead**: Lightweight instrumentation with negligible performance impact

### Thread Safety
- **Reader-Writer Locks**: Concurrent reads with exclusive writes
- **Lock-Free Operations**: Where possible, uses lock-free data structures
- **Deadlock Prevention**: Careful lock ordering and timeout mechanisms

### Monitoring Capabilities
- **Access Pattern Tracking**: Monitors operation frequency and performance
- **Buffer Utilization**: Real-time buffer usage statistics
- **Performance Metrics**: Detailed timing and success rate analysis

## üß™ Testing

### Comprehensive Test Coverage
- **Unit Tests**: Core functionality and edge cases
- **Concurrency Tests**: Thread-safety and race condition testing
- **Performance Tests**: Benchmarking and stress testing
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflow validation

### Test Frameworks
- **Swift Testing**: Modern Swift testing with macro support
- **Performance Testing**: Memory usage and execution time validation
- **Concurrency Testing**: Multi-threaded operation verification
