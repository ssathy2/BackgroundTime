## üì± LinkedIn Announcement Template

```
üöÄ Excited to announce the beta release of BackgroundTime SDK!

After months of development, I'm sharing my solution to one of iOS development's most challenging problems: monitoring background task performance.

üîç **What it does:**
BackgroundTime SDK automatically tracks ALL BackgroundTasks API usage in your iOS app using method swizzling - zero code changes required!

‚ú® **Key Features:**
‚Ä¢ Automatic monitoring via method swizzling
‚Ä¢ Beautiful SwiftUI dashboard with 4 analytical tabs
‚Ä¢ Real-time performance metrics and error analysis
‚Ä¢ Support for iOS 15+ across all Apple platforms
‚Ä¢ Comprehensive test suite with Swift Testing framework
‚Ä¢ Zero-configuration setup - just initialize and go!

üìä **Perfect for:**
‚Ä¢ iOS developers who want visibility into background processing
‚Ä¢ Teams monitoring production app performance
‚Ä¢ Anyone debugging background task failures
‚Ä¢ Managers tracking app reliability metrics

üõ† **Built with modern Swift:**
‚Ä¢ Swift 6.0 with strict concurrency
‚Ä¢ SwiftUI + Swift Charts for beautiful visualizations
‚Ä¢ Method swizzling for seamless integration
‚Ä¢ Thread-safe data storage and analytics

The dashboard provides four comprehensive views:
üìà Overview - Success rates and execution patterns
‚è∞ Timeline - Real-time event stream
üéØ Performance - Duration trends and task-specific metrics  
üö® Errors - Failure analysis and system constraint impacts

This has been a passion project combining my love for iOS development, system-level programming, and developer tooling. Method swizzling was particularly fun to implement safely!

Beta feedback welcome! Planning the stable 1.0 release based on community input.
